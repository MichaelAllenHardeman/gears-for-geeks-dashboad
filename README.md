# Gears for Geeks Dashboard

This was a project I hacked up in a few hours, to help my friend win a contest at work. He built a raspberry pi controlled robot that would drive a course and read certain things off the ground as it went. This program was a quick UI and backend he could push certain checkpoint data too.

## Back End Setup

### Install Back End Dependencies

    npm install

### Start Back End

    node app.js

## Front End Setup

### Prerequisites

First, install [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) using
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

    npm install -g polymer-cli

Second, install [Bower](https://bower.io/) using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)

    npm install -g bower

### Install Front End Dependencies

    bower install

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8081` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    polymer serve

### Build

The `polymer build` command builds your Polymer application for production, using build configuration options provided by the command line or in your project's `polymer.json` file.  

You can configure your `polymer.json` file to create multiple builds. This is necessary if you will be serving different builds optimized for different browsers. You can define your own named builds, or use presets. See the documentation on [building your project for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/build-for-production) for more information.

The Polymer Starter Kit is configured to create three builds using [the three supported presets](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/build-for-production#build-presets):

```
"builds": [
  {
    "preset": "es5-bundled"
  },
  {
    "preset": "es6-bundled"
  },
  {
    "preset": "es6-unbundled"
  }
]
```

Builds will be output to a subdirectory under the `build/` directory as follows:

```
build/
  es5-bundled/
  es6-bundled/
  es6-unbundled/
```

* `es5-bundled` is a bundled, minified build with a service worker. ES6 code is compiled to ES5 for compatibility with older browsers.
* `es6-bundled` is a bundled, minified build with a service worker. ES6 code is served as-is. This build is for browsers that can handle ES6 code - see [building your project for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/build-for-production#compiling) for a list.
* `es6-unbundled` is an unbundled, minified build with a service worker. ES6 code is served as-is. This build is for browsers that support HTTP/2 push.

Run `polymer help build` for the full list of available options and optimizations. Also, see the documentation on the [polymer.json specification](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/tools/polymer-json) and [building your Polymer application for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/build-for-production).

### Preview the build

This command serves your app. Replace `build-folder-name` with the folder name of the build you want to serve.

    polymer serve build/build-folder-name/
